== Introduction

Blockchains as a new paradigm. Based on decades of research and experimentation.
- Cryptographic Hash Functions
- Digital Signatures
- Public Key Crypto
- P2P Networking
- Consensus
- Game theory

Put these together and you have blockchain.

=== Decentralized Applications
- Bitcoin with a scripting language for complex transactions
- As often in software engineering, strive to generalize
- The Ethereum Virtual Machine
- Computation mechanisms of the network
-- Ever node maintains the state of the world, which they audit
-- Low total processing power
